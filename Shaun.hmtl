		<h3> Random Historys </h3>
		<i> The Greeks and Romans were one of the first civilizations in Europe. Then there was the colonist, of America and Africa. When the Scramble for Africa begin, when the Great Powers, started the Conference of Berlin. They gave Tusinia to France, with the Italians having claims to the land and would be upset, to calm the Italians the French and British promised Italy to take Ottoman Libya. The Italians didn't act on this promise until 1911. During, the Second Morrocan Crisis, where the Germans and the French fought, the British had to step in and gave France what they want, but they had to give the Germans parts of the French Congo. After the Italian victory during the Turkish-Italo War, the Balkan Nations would feel the Ottoman weakness and would fight to liberate their people. They would win and push the Ottomans out of Europe, only keeping part of Eastern Thrace. The Bulgars feeling cheated from what they have gained would invade Serbia and Greece, this would fail and the Ottomans and Romania wanting to get their claims would also join the invasion defeating the Bulgars. Ottomans got all of Eastern Thrace, Serbia got the rest of Macedonia, and Greece got Greek Macedonia, and Romania would get Southern Dobjuia. The Japanese an expandist power would invade Manchuria, which is under Russian Influence which would start a war with Russia. The Japanese would be winning against Russia which is a great power, and would have America talk it out with the Japanese and Russians, giving Japan Port Aruthur, Southern Railway in Manchuria, and influence within China. This would make Japan the first Asian Nation that has defeated a Great Power. When the Qing was turned into the Republic of China for 1912, the Republic of China would collapse into Civil War. It was official in 1916. The Japanese would have a deal with the British to invade the German holdings in Asia, to expand their empire. With the Germans declining the Japanese demands they would invade the German Islands and their port in China. The Germans would no long have any holdings in Asia. The Japanese would start to try to influence Shandong. With occuping much of their important land. </i>
		<h3> Scamble for Africa </h3>
		<i> So like the Great Powers of Europea decided to do something classic like Great Power bullying. The Great Powers went to Berlin and divided Africa before that the Great Powers were racing to colonize Africa. Like Britain in South Africa, and Egypt. France in Algeria. Spain in Morroco. Italy just wanting land, and Germany somewhere in Africa. The meeting in Berlin went well, with spliting up Africa between them. Ethiopia somehow was the only African power not given to a Great Power.  </i>
		<h3> My Fun Alternate History </h3>
		<i> Alright, I'm guessing that you don't know about the ANI? The ANI was a party formed in Dec. 1910. They were the Italian Nationalist Assication, they would Pro-Monarchy, Nationalist, Anti-Socialist, industrialist, militarist and others. Since they were only supported by the Elites and Military Leaders, they also followed values of the Church which could of have them gained support from them to expand their influence to the rurals. They also could of try to get support from the workers and soldiers. Once the ANI did their own March on Rome. The King being pressured and fear a civil war would allow Enrico Corradini to be appointed Prime Minister with him in power it would ease the Nationalist and prevent a civil war from happening, but the Italian stance with Germania and other nations will be different. Like invasion of Albania in 1925.</i>
